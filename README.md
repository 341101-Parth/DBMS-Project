This Project is done only for educational and learning purpose.

We have choosen Swiggy for our project.
Since the real HR data is confidential and cannot be used, hence we have come up with a fictional and hypothetical dataset. 
Advantages of using this data set
1. Real-world relevance: Although the data is fictional, this data set helps to learn SQL in context to real business environments
2. Multi-dimensional data set: The data set contains employee details, departments, functional areas, addresses, age and demohraphics. This allowed us to practice a wide variety of SQL operations involving multiple dimensions of information, similar to corporate databases. 
3. Supports complex SQL series: The structure naturally encourages joins between tables, grouping and aggregation etc. 
4. Encourages problem solving mindset: The dataset can be used to generate real questions such as "which department has the highest employees? ", " Which city has the most staff? ”, "What is the average age per department? ", " Find employees working in more than one area. " This improves analytical thinking using SQL
